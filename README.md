# Punch out tester

PunchOut is a collection of standards that facilitate integration between suppliers eCommerce sites and their buyerâ€™s eProcurement systems. The two most well-known stardards
are OCI and cXML.

This site allows users to simulate punchout to suppliers eCommerce sites and inspect the data in and out. I use this site to test changes to punchout gateway and eCommerce site.

The project [SimFre/Punchout](https://github.com/SimFre/Punchout) inspired the development. The tech stack includes Nuxt/Vue/Tailwind/TypeScript.
